    <h1>Welcome to IP Range finder!</h1>
    <h2>Use this tool to parse your effective routes and Dump Routing Info files and find which range is maching for a specific IP</h2>
    <h3>The Dump Routing Info file parsing is now fully integrated into ASC.</h3>
    <p>Just go to the ExpressRoute resource, click on the "Diagnostics Tab" and at the bottom you will find the new ExR IP Range Finder tool</p>
    <h3>To parse the Effective Routes file follow these steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to either the NIC ASC page and get the NIC Effective Routes, or to the VM Diagnostics blade on ASC and run a test traffic to get the NIC Effective Routes</li>
        <li>Once you have the results for the effective routes you need to download the Excel file from ASC</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To do so, click on the "Export to Excel file" (first button on the top right corner of the table)<img src="/static/img/excel_button.png" alt="excel_button" height="50"></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Here on the tool, click on the "Choose File" button on the second slot and upload the Effective Routes Excel file</li>
        <li>On the second slot textbox type in the IP for which you want to find the maching range</li>
        <li>Click on the "Upload effective routes excel file" button to submit and parse the file</li>
        <li>You will be then directed to the output page with the result. If no range matched the IP you will get an empty response.</li>
    </ol>
